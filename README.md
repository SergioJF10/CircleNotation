# CircleNotation
 Python module for representing an statevector of a single-qubit quantum system with the circle notation.

For using it in your project just clone the repo, create a virtual environment for isolating the dependencies (recommended), install the requirements (may take a while). Now, you can decide whether to execute from terminal or use it in a project.

For its usage in a Python project with Qiskit statevector objects, import the `circle_notation` module and call the `circle_notation(sv)`, where `sv` is the Qiskit statevector which we desire to represent with this representation.
